privileged-api-control
**********************


Description
===========

This service is used to restrict the control plane service apis; so
that everybody wonâ€™t be able to access those apis. There are two main
resouces defined as a part of this service 1. PrivilegedApiControl:
This is created by the customer which defines which service apis are

   controlled and who can access it.

2. PrivilegedApiRequest: This is a request object again created by the
   customer operators who           seek access to those privileged
   apis. After a request is obtained based on the
   PrivilegedAccessControl for which the api belongs to, either it can
   be approved so that the          requested person can execute the
   service apis or it will wait for the customer to approve it.
