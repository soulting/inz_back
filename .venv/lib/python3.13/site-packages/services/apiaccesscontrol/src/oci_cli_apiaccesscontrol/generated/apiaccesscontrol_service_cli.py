After a request is obtained based on the                       PrivilegedAccessControl for which the api belongs to, either it can be approved so that the          requested person can execute the service apis or it will wait for the customer to approve it."""), short_help=cli_util.override('privileged_api_work_request.apiaccesscontrol_service_group.short_help', """Oracle API Access Control"""))
